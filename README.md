# GlediatorToDisk
A simple tool that modifies the Glediator program so that any ArtNet output is instead saved to files, which can then be moved to other platforms and used as a source for playback.

Leverages AspectJ to modify certain class functionality at load-time, so usage does not modify the original software in any permanent way.
